## About
My name is Thule Norge. I'm a coder, musician etc. Also, I like to shake the air in the comments, but as it always happens, it's doesn't always get to the action. I opened my own private company one year ago (as of December, 2024). It's priniting photos and documents. Sometimes I create CD's and merch. Why I'm photographer? - Because My parents are working photographers and I don't want work to the factory. When I was 14 years old I start programming. My first programs was 2D runner and Hello world application (base) for Android. Also, I try learn Unity and Blender, but I scored the bolt at 35mm because I was Schoolboy. When I was 17 years old, I read [this article](https://habr.com/ru/articles/248153/) and solve: I must create something better. Moreover, I have always dreamed of creating my own physically realistic game and I think I got it!
