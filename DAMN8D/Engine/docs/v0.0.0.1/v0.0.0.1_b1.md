# DAMN8D v0.0.0.1_b1 - Docs

## Summary

DAMN8D (next "Engine") is contains 3 controls:

* Text field
* Button
* Canvas

You can input some shader program to the text field and if you press button you can see rendered data into the canvas.

## Internal variables

In this version, Engine contains 4 internal variables: `u_Frame`, `u_MouseKeys`, `u_MouseMove` and `u_Resolution`

* `u_Frame` returns frame id, which equivalents ms. For better performance multiply this value to `60.0`.\
  Type: `float`
* `u_Keys[N]` returns code of pressed key. Inddex `N` is means order of pressed keys. `u_Keys[0]` is `Ctrl` and `u_Keys[3]` is `Alt` for example. `N`-range starts from 0 and ends to 9.\
  Full list of `u_Keys`-variables:
  + `u_Keys[0]`
  + `u_Keys[1]`
  + `u_Keys[2]`
  + `u_Keys[3]`
  + `u_Keys[4]`
  + `u_Keys[5]`
  + `u_Keys[6]`
  + `u_Keys[7]`
  + `u_Keys[8]`
  + `u_Keys[9]`\
  Type: `int`
* `u_MouseKeys` returns pressed mouse keys include wheel and right key. It is multiple variable.\
  Type: `vec3`
* `u_MouseMove` returns mouse coordinates. Use for moving objects and scrolling.\
  Type: `vec3`
* `u_Resolution` returns screen Resolution. It's better for computing uv and texture coordinates.\
  Type: `vec2`

## Manual

If you want to control your working program, you need just press to canvas and keyboard input will active. If you press to text field, you are activate editor mode.
