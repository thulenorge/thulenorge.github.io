# DAMN8D v0.0.0.1_a - Docs

## Summary

DAMN8D (next "Engine") is contains 3 controls:

* Text field
* Button
* Canvas

You can input some shader program to the text field and if you press button you can see rendered data into the canvas.

## Internal variables

In this version, Engine contains 4 internal variables: `u_Frame`, `u_MouseKeys`, `u_MouseMove` and `u_Resolution`

* `u_Frame` returns frame id, which equivalents ms. For better performance multiply this value to `60.0`.\
  Type: `float`
* `u_MouseKeys` returns pressed mouse keys include wheel and right key. It is multiple variable.\
  Type: `vec3`
* `u_MouseMove` returns mouse coordinates. Use for moving objects and scrolling.\
  Type: `vec3`
* `u_Resolution` returns screen Resolution. It's better for computing uv and texture coordinates.\
  Type: `vec2`
