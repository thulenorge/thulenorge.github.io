# DAMN8D v0.0.0.1

## Summary

It is a second revision of first version of Engine with some own micro updates. In previous revisions it was not so noticeable, but if you open the console, various errors popped up there. Those that were on a white background are shader errors. They are needed for debugging and finding errors in the shaders themselves. And those that are highlighted in red or yellow are software errors made by the developer of this software, that is, me. These errors themselves are not critical and do not affect the work, but still I want the product to be of good quality. One way or another, the beginning of error correction was laid in the same way as it was laid for the rest of the program functions at the moment ;3. Joke. Of course, there will be new functions and error fixes and other goodies
